# Vampire Survivors Clone in Godot

I have been following a tutorial series on YouTube by [Branno](https://www.youtube.com/@BrannoDev) where he shows you how to create a [Vampire Survivors](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/) clone. 

I am using his tutorial series (found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtosjGHWDab682nfZ1f6JSQ1cjap7Ieeb)) to get a feel for Godot Engine and Godot 4. I have tried to use Godot in the past, but now I am really trying to make an effort to learn it. 

## What's been implemented from the tutorial
- The GUI
  - Health bar
  - Experience bar
  - Game timer
  - Level Up Menu
  - Icons for what items the player has collected
  - Win/Lose Screen 
  - Main Menu
- Basic Animations
  - The player will animate only while walking
  - The enemies are in a constant state of animation
- Player Movement
- Basic Enemies
  - The enemies spawn in from just outside the screen.
  - The enemies will constnatly walk towards the player.
  - These basic enemies deal 1 hp worth of damage as they bump into the player.
- Basic Attacks
  - Ice Spear
  - Tornado
  - Javelin
- Basic Items
  - Food (Heals the Player)
  - Ring (Adds an additional bullet per shot)
  - Tome (Makes spells larger)
  - Armor (Grants Armor)
  - Speed Shoes (Player moves faster)
  - Scroll (Decreases spell cooldown)
- Added additional enemies:
	- Kobold (Strong)
	- Cyclops
	- Juggernaut
	- Amoeba (This game's version of the Reaper)


## Ideas I want to Add after the tutorial
- All ideas have been turned into GitHub Issues.
